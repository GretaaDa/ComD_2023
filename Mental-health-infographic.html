        <h2>What is mental health?</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health is a state of well-being in which one's mind, emotions,
          thoughts and behaviors are in constant flux.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental health encompasses the complex texture of a person's psychological
          and emotional state, and is frequently referred to as the cornerstone of holistic well-being. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It creates the groundwork for a satisfying existence by reshaping emotions,
          ideas, actions, and moods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental illnesses present in a variety of ways and always have distinct effects
          on the body. For example, eating disorders have a direct effect on the body,
          whereas depression has a significant impact on mental health.
