        <h2>What is mental health?</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health is a state of well-being in which one's mind, emotions,
          thoughts and behaviors are in constant flux. Our emotional,
          psychological, and social well-being are all parts of our mental
          health. It influences our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and
          influences how we respond to stress, interact with others, and make
          decisions. All phases of life, from infancy and adolescence to
          adulthood, place importance on mental wellness. Experiencing mental
          health issues may have a lasting impact on your thoughts, emotions,
          and actions.
